Players Objective: The goal of the game is to move the paddle with the mouse to allow it to hit the moving ball in order to hit objects on the screen that give you points (square, circle, paddle). The player needs to earn 8 points in order to win the game. There will also be objects that will obstruct the player's ability to get the 8 points. These objects will make the player lose points so the player must avoid them (triangle, line). The player can click the mouse button in order to turn the ball invisible, allowing the ball to avoid intersecting objects. The player can click the mouse button again to make the ball visible again. Some objects can only be hit once and will disappear after (circle, square, triangle). The score will be kept in the top left corner and will change after the ball intersects an object. The win and lose screen will be displayed to show when the game is over.
